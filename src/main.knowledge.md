## Purpose
This file is the entry point of the application. It's responsible for:
- Rendering the initial UI
- Handling user interactions
- Updating the UI based on the state machine

## Key Points
- The UI is generated dynamically based on the state machine definition.
- Button text is populated directly from the state machine transitions.
- User interactions are currently logged but not yet tied to state transitions.

## TODO
- Implement state transitions when buttons are clicked.
- Update the UI to reflect the current state after each transition.
- Consider adding more detailed explanations or visual feedback for each state.
