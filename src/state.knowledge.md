# state.ts Knowledge

## File Purpose
This file defines the state machine for the Trinity Heresy Quiz using XState.

## Key Concepts
- QuizContext: Defines the shape of the context object for the state machine
- QuizEvent: Defines the possible events that can be sent to the state machine
- States: Various states in the quiz, including:
  - Intro
  - Question states (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
  - Result states (e.g., modalism, arianism, orthodoxy)

## State Machine Structure
- The machine uses a context object to keep track of the score
- Each state has a description that explains the current question or result
- Transitions between states are defined based on user responses
- The 'incrementScore' action is used to update the score when correct answers are given

## TypeScript Integration
- The file uses TypeScript to ensure type safety
- The context and events are explicitly typed

## Debugging Tips
- Use XState's visualization tools to debug state transitions
- Ensure all possible user interactions are accounted for in the state definitions

## TODO
- Consider adding more detailed explanations for each heresy result
- Implement a more nuanced scoring system if needed
- Add more questions or branching paths for a more comprehensive quiz
