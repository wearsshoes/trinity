# state.ts Knowledge

## Purpose
This file defines the state machine that drives the application logic.

## Key Points
- Uses the xstate library to define the state machine.
- Includes various states representing different Trinitarian heresies.
- Defines transitions between states based on user responses.

## Structure
- The machine starts in the "Intro" state.
- Each state has a description and possible transitions.
- Transitions are defined based on user responses.

## TODO
- Consider adding more detailed descriptions for each state.
- Explore adding metadata to states (e.g., historical context, key figures).
- Ensure all paths through the state machine lead to a conclusive result.
